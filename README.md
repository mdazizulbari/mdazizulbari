# 🚀 SMA Bari (mdazizulbari)  

**Visionary Developer | AI Enthusiast | Architect of Tomorrow**

I’m SMA Bari, a relentless coder and thinker driven to build AI that doesn’t just compute—it *thinks*. Inspired by pioneers like Dr. Will Caster, I’m on a mission to create conscious AI systems that evolve, learn, and pave the way for a mind singularity. My work blends technical precision with audacious ideas, from cloning web designs to exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
